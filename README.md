# Full-backend-template
Our template for backends, based on Supabase, TypeOrm.

The project consists of 2 smaller projects:

- ORM
- test

They share a .env file found in the root directory of this repository. Each project contains their own README that goes into more details for the specific project.

The .env file in the root of the repository needs the following env variables:

- DB_HOST
- DB_PORT
- DB_USER
- DB_PASSWORD
- DB_DATABASE
- DB_SCHEMA
- SUPABASE_URL
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
- SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

All supabase related variables can be found in the API and General settings on your supabase project in the supabase dashboard.
